<h2 id="content-the-most-important-features-of-a-website-builder">The most important features of a website builder</h2>
<p>With the help of a website builder, you can create a professional website without a great deal of technical effort. Depending on your requirements and goals, you should carefully consider which functions are most important for your individual needs. While some website builders increasingly rely on artificial intelligence (AI), others stand out with proven drag-and-drop editors and customizable templates. Here are the key features you should definitely look for when choosing the best website builder for you:</p>
<h3 id="content-user-friendliness">User friendliness</h3>
<p>A good website builder should have an intuitive user interface that can even be understood by people without programming experience. Pay attention to the following functions:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Drag-and-drop interface:</strong> The ability to visually move and place elements such as text, images and buttons without having to write code is a key benefit.</li>
<li><strong>Pre-built templates:</strong> Templates give you a solid foundation and help you envision the potential of your website.</li>
<li><strong>Clear settings and customization options:</strong> You should be able to adjust colors, fonts and layouts without getting lost in a maze of menus.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="content-design-flexibility">Design flexibility</h3>
<p>To stand out from the competition, it is important to choose a website builder that allows you to customize your website. These functions should be available:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Customizable templates:</strong> While templates are a good starting point, the ability to customize them is critical to making your website stand out. Look for providers that allow you at least some flexibility in customizing the templates.</li>
<li><strong>Mobile responsiveness:</strong> Your website needs to look good and be usable on all devices, from smartphones to desktops. Website builders should include tools that allow you to customize how your website looks on different screen sizes.</li>
<li><strong>Various design options:</strong> With options to change colors, fonts, backgrounds and spacing, you can determine the aesthetics of your website yourself and adapt it to your corporate design.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="content-basic-functions">Basic functions</h3>
<p>A website builder should offer more than just an appealing design. These core features will help you create a website that is user-friendly and can be found on Google:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Blogging features:</strong> If you want to share written content, look for a website builder with a built-in blog system or easy integration with blogging platforms. By publishing relevant content, you can increase your visibility on Google.</li>
<li><strong>Contact forms:</strong> A simple contact form allows website visitors to get in touch with you directly.</li>
<li><strong>SEO basics:</strong> A website builder should at least allow you to edit page titles and meta descriptions. Good control over SEO settings gives you the opportunity to insert targeted keywords and optimize the appearance of your website in search results.</li>
<li><strong>Image optimization:</strong> The speed of the website is also important! Look for providers that have some form of image compression or optimization. Slow loading times can have a negative impact on usability and search engine rankings.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="content-support-and-assistance">Support and assistance</h3>
<p>When using a website builder, good support for questions or troubleshooting is invaluable, especially if you do not yet have extensive experience in creating websites. You should therefore also pay attention to the following before deciding on a website builder:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Documentation and tutorials:</strong> Clear guides and step-by-step instructions will help you familiarize yourself with the new tool.</li>
<li><strong>Forums and user groups:</strong> The opportunity to get in touch with other users, ask questions and share solutions is another level of support.</li>
<li><strong>Support channels:</strong> Is 24/7 support available to quickly resolve urgent issues? Can you reach the support team via email, live chat, or phone? For specific concerns, it’s important to have designated contacts who can offer you targeted, expert assistance.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="content-legal-requirements">Legal requirements</h3>
<p>Another important aspect when choosing a website builder is the legal requirements, particularly with regard to data protection. Pay attention to the following points:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Data protection compliance (GDPR):</strong> Make sure that the website builder is GDPR-compliant if you’re doing business in the EU. Data protection declarations and legal notices should be easy to integrate and adapt.</li>
<li><strong>Legally compliant texts:</strong> Some website builders provide ready-to-use, legally compliant templates for legal notices and privacy policies.</li>
<li><strong>Cookie banners and tracking options:</strong> A good toolkit should include functions that make it easy to implement cookie banners that comply with legal requirements. Also look for transparent tracking and data collection options.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>WordPress plugin</li>
<li>Theme Builder &amp; Loop Builder</li>
<li>Cloud hosting optional</li>
<li>AI-powered features</li>
</ul>
<p>The Elementor page builder is a user-friendly solution for quickly creating professional websites based on <a class="link-internal" data-linkid="guides/digital-guide/en-us/page-36914/int/content/top-10-of-the-best-website-builders-current-year-ioguideus3970/wordpress" data-t3-link="true" href="https://www.ionos.com/digitalguide/hosting/blogs/creating-a-website-with-wordpress-a-beginners-guide/" target="_top">WordPress</a>.

The basic version of Elementor is free and offers a surprising number of functions.</p>
<p>The Pro version of Elementor gives users access to advanced features such as the Theme Builder and the Loop Builder, which make it possible to display dynamic content such as blog posts or product lists in a clear way.

<p>WordPress itself, as a content management system (CMS), has no integrated solutions for <strong>privacy, cookies and legal notices</strong>.

<p><strong>Benefits:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Three levels of pricing</li>
<li>Global page editing</li>
<li>SEO and marketing tools</li>
</ul>
<p>Weebly’s website builder offers three plan options: a free version, the Professional plan for 14 euros (around 15 dollars) per month and the Performance plan for 25 euros (around 27 dollars) per month. While Weebly enables solid websites to be easily created, the <strong>e-commerce functions are limited</strong>. Although extensive product information and individualized articles can be offered, if you want to integrate PayPal, this requires an upgrade. In addition, shipping service providers such as DHL cannot be integrated directly and customizing invoices is limited.</p>
<p>In terms of design, Weebly provides a <strong>limited range of responsive design options</strong> compared to its competitors. It does not offer pre-made templates for quick website design customization. However, with global page editing, you can modify color schemes, fonts, buttons, and layouts across all subpages at once, creating a consistent and harmonious look.</p>
<p>Content such as text, image galleries and videos can be easily integrated, and Weebly also provides a beginner-friendly wizard to help out at the start. The platform provides effective <strong>SEO and marketing tools</strong>; however, the terms and conditions and privacy policies are not legally foolproof. As well as a support team, Weebly provides a community forum where users can assist each other.</p>

<p><strong>Benefits:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Intuitive operability</li>
<li>Flexible design</li>
<li>Special features e.g. for restaurants</li>
</ul>
<p>The Squarespace website builder is easy and intuitive to use; there are <strong>professional templates with high design quality</strong>. The platform also offers a wide range of SEO and marketing tools, along with a blog feature that outperforms many competitors. However, its relatively slow loading times and lack of a backup function are notable drawbacks. Support is limited to email and live chat. Additionally, the terms and privacy policies fall short of legal requirements due to the server location in the United States, and there are no legally compliant templates for legal notices or data protection.</p>
<p>Squarespace e-commerce provides <strong>versatile layout options</strong>, enabling you to arrange page elements like forms, videos, and text freely. Besides offering a web shop and blog, you can also create protected member areas and set up menus with a reservation feature using OpenTable.</p>
<p>This builder is aimed at both beginners and advanced users who aren’t satisfied with their current system. It is particularly suitable for coaches, small consulting agencies, and solo freelancers who want to showcase their <strong>portfolio</strong> or sell digital products and services without having to get deeply involved in the technology.

<li>AI-powered design assistant for faster page creation</li>
</ul>
<p>Webflow is a robust website builder known for its powerful design capabilities and flexibility. It offers a visual design interface with a drag-and-drop editor, allowing users to create responsive websites without writing code while providing control over CSS properties like grids and typography. Webflow includes a built-in CMS for content management, responsive design features, hosting with security measures like SSL and global CDNs, e-commerce capabilities, and tools for <a class="link-internal" data-linkid="guides/digital-guide/en-us/page-36914/int/content/top-10-of-the-best-website-builders-current-year-ioguideus3970/seo-optimization" data-t3-link="true" href="https://www.ionos.com/digitalguide/online-marketing/search-engine-marketing/the-basics-of-search-engine-optimization/" target="_top">SEO optimization</a>. In recent updates, Webflow introduced an <strong>AI Assistant</strong> that helps streamline the design process by automatically suggesting and generating page sections based on the existing design system. This significantly speeds up workflow, especially for larger projects.</p>
<p>Users can also create complex animations and integrate custom HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The platform’s strengths lie in its design flexibility and advanced features, making it ideal for designers who want to create unique websites. However, Webflow can have a <strong>steep learning curve for beginners</strong>, and its pricing might be higher than some other website builders. Additionally, while the number of pre-designed templates is growing, it remains limited compared to competitors like Wix or Squarespace. Its e-commerce functionality, although continually improving, may still fall short for managing large-scale online stores when compared to specialized platforms like Shopify.</p>
<p>There is a free plan available for those first starting out with Webflow. The Business plan costs 39 dollars per month, but if you’re looking for an even more advanced solution, the Enterprise plan is available upon request, which comes with enterprise security and support.</p>

<p><strong>Benefits:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Apps with additional functions</li>
<li>Version history</li>
<li>Marketing suite</li>
<li>AI website builder</li>
</ul>
<p>Wix is a popular website builder that provides <strong>almost 1,000 design templates</strong> and numerous expandable functions via apps. The website builder enables you to create a professional website and offers a permanent free plan with a Wix extension in the URL and an advertising banner on the page.</p>
<p>A standout feature of Wix is the version history that allows you to undo changes, which is especially helpful for beginners. Wix supports <strong>responsive design</strong> meaning that websites are displayed well on all devices.</p>
<p>While the platform offers extensive features, there are some drawbacks, especially regarding data protection, since the <strong>servers are located outside the EU</strong>, which can lead to GDPR compliance issues. Wix does not provide support for setting up cookie banners, privacy policies, and other legally required elements.</p>
<p>Compared to the other providers mentioned, the plan prices, ranging from 13 to 177 euros (around 15 to 195 dollars), are relatively high. However, Wix’s Business Elite plan includes features that are particularly beneficial for medium-sized businesses, such as the ability to integrate up to 15 collaborators, unlimited storage space, and an advanced marketing suite.</p>

<li>Supports various payment methods</li>
<li>Social media connections</li>
</ul>
<p>The GoDaddy website builder makes it easy to create appealing websites and online stores, as well as supporting blogs and scheduled services like fitness classes or webinars. With <strong>220 templates</strong> available, designing a layout quickly is straightforward.</p>
<p>GoDaddy provides all the necessary tools for selling products, including support for all major payment methods. However, <strong>shipping needs to be managed manually</strong>, and invoicing is limited to a basic email solution.</p>

Conveniently, GoDaddy has a graphic tool for creating Facebook ads, flyers and Instagram stories. Customer support is available at certain times via telephone and chat. As the servers are also located in the USA, it is important to keep an eye on data protection. Prices lie between 9.99 and 20.99 dollars.</p> </div>
